# Summary

# Details
I used the `ex2.py` as a template and extended support for `%`, `==`, `!=`, `<`,
 `>`, `<=`, `>=`. I updated the grammar to support these new operators and also
 updated the implementer code to support these new operators. 

# Testing/Evaluation and  Difficulties
- I added the custom tests `eq.txt`, `neq.txt`, `lt.txt`, `gt.txt`, `lte.txt`,
 `gte.txt`, `mod.txt` to test the new operators.
- An issue I ran into was that the application of parenthesis would be very 
particular. For example the following is fine:
```
3 * x == 207
x == ((1 - 23) * (69 + 23) + 23 * (69 - 1 + 23))
```

But this would not work:
```
3 * x == 207
x == ((1 - 23) * (69 + 23) + 23 * (69 - 1 + 23))
```
