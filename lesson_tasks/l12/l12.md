# Details
- I first modified the `brili.ts` and created a `brili-trace.ts` that would only log the instructions that are executed. I did this by modifying the state passed through the layers of eval functions. When encountering `br` or `jmp`, I made sure to log additional `guard`s to ensure that when this trace is stitched into the program, we would abort the speculation when the path deviates from the trace.
- I then created a `stitch_trace.py` that would take in a trace file and a bril program and stitch the trace into the program. Since most of the heavy lifting was done already when creating the trace, this was a simple task of inserting the trace into the program. I also made sure to create the dummy labels for the guards to short circuit to at the corresponding spot in the original program.

# Testing/Evaluation

I first manually verified that the result of stitching the trace is what I expect by verifying the CFG. I also verify that the output of the stitched trace is the same as the output of the original program. Below an example the CFG of a program and the CFG after stitched with its trace.

I then used the `bril2json` and `brili` tools to verify that the output of the stitched trace is the same as the output of the original program. I verified for `basic.bril`, `gcd.bril`, `fib.bril`, and `fact.bril`.


# Difficulties
The most difficult pat was probably finding the right spots in the original program to insert the trace was a bit tricky. I had to make sure that the dummy labels were inserted at positions where the specuation could break out to and retain the same behavior as the original program.
